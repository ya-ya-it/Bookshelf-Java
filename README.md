<h1>Commit for assignment 2 is #16</h1>
<p>Hey, Jaret!</p>
<p>Because I had to write tests and because of my travel I didn't have enough 
time and stable Internet to finish the assignment in time. So the commit for the mark 
(December 22) is commit #16. But I want to finish the 
assignment anyway - its really cool assignment - so I will do few more commits.

Could you please take a look at my new code? The only issue I have is in Admin 
panel where I'm trying to create a new user. I don't know why, but when I'm pressing
"Add new user" from All user panel, my existing session is override so now the user is null.
And now if I press back, it brings me to the Log in screen

Marry Christmas and Happy New Year!

UPD. Dec. 26 Almost everything is done!

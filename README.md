<h1>Commit for assignment 2 is #16</h1>
<p>Hey, Jaret!</p>
<p>Because I had to write tests and because of my travel I didn't have enough time to finish assignment in time. So the commit which I did before due date (December 22) is commit #16. But I want to finish the assignment, so I'm going to continue commiting. 

Happy Christmas and New Year!

<h1>Commit for assignment 2 is #16</h1>
<p>Hey, Jaret!</p>
<p>Because I had to write tests and because of my travel I didn't have enough 
time and stable Internet to finish the assignment in time. So the commit for the mark 
(December 22) is commit #16. But I want to finish the 
assignment anyway - its really cool assignment - so I will do few more commits.

Marry Christmas and Happy New Year!
